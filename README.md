# Cryptocurrency Prediction Artificial Intelligence

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict cryptocurrency price movements based on historical data and other relevant factors. The goal is to develop an intelligent system that can analyze market trends and assist in making informed investment decisions.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Develop an artificial intelligence model to predict cryptocurrency trends and price movements.

- **Key Features:**
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning of historical cryptocurrency data.
  - Feature engineering including technical indicators and market sentiment analysis.
  - Training and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification, deep learning).
  - Visualization of prediction results and model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset file included in this repository is `Cryptocurrency Prediction Artificial Intelligence.csv`. Although a detailed description of the dataset is pending further review, it is expected to include:

- **Columns:**  
  (e.g., Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and other market indicators)

- **Rows:**  
  Each row represents data for a specific time interval, capturing the marketâ€™s behavior over time.

> **Note:**  
> Please review the dataset to confirm the exact columns, data types, and any missing values. Additional documentation and preprocessing steps will be added as the project evolves.
