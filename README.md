# Cryptocurrency Prediction Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting cryptocurrency price movements using artificial intelligence techniques. By leveraging historical market data, the goal is to develop a robust system that can help in making informed investment decisions.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Build an AI model capable of analyzing historical cryptocurrency data to forecast future price movements.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Data Analysis:** Initial exploration and preprocessing of historical cryptocurrency market data.
  - **Model Training:** Utilizing machine learning and deep learning models to predict cryptocurrency trends.
  - **Visualization:** Graphical representation of data trends and model performance metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is provided in the file `Cryptocurrency Prediction Artificial Intelligence.csv`. It includes the following nine columns:

1. **unix:**  
   Represents the timestamp in Unix epoch format (the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970). This format is useful for precise time calculations and sorting the records chronologically.

2. **date:**  
   Provides a human-readable date format corresponding to the Unix timestamp. This makes it easier to quickly identify the exact date and time for each record.

3. **symbol:**  
   Denotes the cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., XRP, BTC, etc.), identifying which cryptocurrency the record is associated with.

4. **open:**  
   The opening price of the cryptocurrency at the beginning of the recorded time interval. This value is typically used as the starting point for trading analysis.

5. **high:**  
   The highest price reached by the cryptocurrency during the time interval. This indicates the peak price within that period.

6. **low:**  
   The lowest price reached during the time interval. This helps in understanding the minimum price fluctuations in the market.

7. **close:**  
   The closing price at the end of the time interval, often used as a reference for calculating daily returns or trends.

8. **Volume XRP:**  
   The trading volume measured in the cryptocurrency itself (in this case, XRP). This shows how much of the cryptocurrency was traded during the time interval.

9. **Volume USDT:**  
   The trading volume expressed in USDT (Tether), a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. This provides insight into the trading activity in terms of a fiat-equivalent currency.
